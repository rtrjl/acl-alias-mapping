Enhancements:

  -  Changed default connect code to used the new NEDCOM Connector.
     The NED connection steps are configured in JSON connection templates,

     or 'proxy' containers) to specify the prompts, commands and states
     required to connect, allowing for flexible connect configuration.
     If for some reason the old connect is required, enable it with the
     'deprecated connection legacy-mode' ned-setting.

    (CISCOIOS-848 / RT30990)

  - Added presence true in interface * / frame-relay interface-dlci to
     correct delete problem.
    (CISCOIOS-845 / RT30961)

cisco-ios v5.6.3 [2017-11-24]
=============================

Enhancements:

  - Added optional 'cisco-ios-proxy-settings proxy-prompt2' ned-setting to be
     able to synchronize the login process on the target. If configured, the
     NED will wait for this pattern after having sent the login command, but
     before proceeding with the login (sending username, password etc).
    (CISCOIOS-841)

  - Extended the  'cisco-ios-proxy-settings remote-command' to allow modification
     of the SSH/TELNET connection command. Accepts $address, $port, $name for
     inserting remote-xxx config, e.g.
      cisco-ios-proxy-settings remote-command "telnet $address $port /vrf Mgmt-intf"
    (CISCOIOS-841)

Corrections:

  - Improved PROXY connection error checking, throwing exception for device
     error output upcon connection failure.
    (CISCOIOS-841)

  - Fixed moving interface [Ten]GigabitEthernet * / service instance dependency
     order problem.
    (CISCOIOS-840 / RT30885)

Enhancements:

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     interface * / ipv6 nd cache expire

cisco-ios v5.6.1 [2017-11-13]
=============================

Enhancements:

  - Commit performance optimization:
     Added cisco-ios behaviour number-of-lines-to-send-in-chunk ned-setting
     in order to be able to send certain config in larger chunks instead of
     line by line. A higher number normally results in better performance
     but may have a negative impact on the error handling. Default is 100
     lines per chunk. If you get an 'Internal ERROR: retry-command', set this
     setting to 1 and report the config line which triggered the exception.
    (CISCOIOS-833)

Corrections:

  - API CHANGE:
     interface * / rate-limit input|output *
      Changed config parameters from modelled leaves to a multi-word-key list
      due to the device treating each value as a key leaf.
    (CISCOIOS-831 / RT30646)

  - Added cli-replace-all on:
     crypto isakmp profile * / ca trust-point
      in order to be able to properly order new entries.

===========================

Enhancements:

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     interface * / no macro auto processing
    (CISCOIOS-818 / RT30422)

  - extended ip access-list modification improvement:
    Added a third method to store and modify extended ip access-lists - resequence.
    Set the new ned-setting cisco-ios-api access-list-resequence to enable.
    Make sure the device does not have 'ip access-list persistent' set.
    Do not specify access-list sequence numbers in NSO CDB. The NED will
     dynamically use the sequence numbers when inserting/moving access-list
     entries by starting of with a 'ip access-list resequence' command.
    To understand the new YANG model, set the access-list(s) on the device and
     sync-from to NSO, and/or grep the YANG file for 'resequence'.
    NOTES: - remark entries are not supported due to IOS does not include them
             in sequence numbering, i.e. they can't be (re)ordered properly.
           - ipv6 is not supported due to lack of ipv6 resequence command.
           - standard ip access-list not supported due to device not ordering
             the lists using the sequence number, entries always added last.
    (CISCOIOS-816)

  - Added ipv6 support with the 'cisco-ios-api new-ip-access-list' ned-setting.
     With this setting enabled the ipv6 access-lists is ordered on the sequence
     number instead of user ordered by the whole rule. Note the YANG changes,
     see tailf-ned-cisco-ios.yang or sync-from device and show for details.
    (CISCOIOS-815 / RT30390)

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     interface */ authentication control-direction

  - API CHANGE
     crypto isakmp profile * / ca trust-point
      changed from leaf to ordered-by user leaf-list to allow for multiple

    (CISCOIOS-806 / RT30269)

  - Added new static warning exception:
     Ignore output when deleting et-analytics / ip flow-export destination due
      to NSO bug with tailf:cli-recursive-delete and dependencies.
    (CISCOIOS-805)

  - Implemented a fix solving problems with interface speed, injecting speed

  - New ned-setting:
     cisco-ios connection-settings send-login-newline
      Set to true in order to send an initial newline in the login phase.
      Usable, for example, if the prompt is lost due to banner config.

  - Throw exception for missing ned-setting leaves at connect.
    (CISCOIOS-586 / RT27811)

     limit when the replace/filter entry should trigger, config-only or
     trans-id-only.
    (CISCOIOS-584)

  - Do not send "snmp trap link-status" when an interface is deleted.
    (CISCOIOS-582 / RT27772)

  - Updated and improved the README file on available ned-settings.

Corrections:

  - Fixed order dependency problem between:
     mpls traffic-eng
     interface * / mpls traffic-eng
    (CISCOIOS-590 / RT27807)

  - Restored support for "show ?" in live-status exec any command, broken

    (CISCOIOS-585 / RT27794)

  - Added cli-replace-all to 'mls qos map cos-dscp|ip-prec-dscp'

================================

Enhancements:

Corrections:

  - Fixed problem with setting and deleting snmp-server user, also affecting
     transaction-id calculation if set in same transaction as a secret.
    (CISCOIOS-574 / RT27673)


cisco-ios v5.1.2 [April 7, 2017]
================================

Enhancements:

  - Added support for restoring lost route-targets in ip vrf when rd is deleted
     or changed. Previously a rd change caused the device to loose all current
     route-targets, and only get newly added ones. The default behaviour is now
     for the NED to restore all route-targets on the device by pushing them
     down again. This new behaviour can be disabled by setting the ned-setting
      cisco-ios-auto ip-vrf-rd-restore to false.
    (CISCOIOS-577 / RT27687)

  - Re-enable service-insertion service-context entries when appnav-controller
     is added in a matching appnav-controller-group. Note: to avoid AppNav
     interface diff, try this new replace-config ned-setting:
      cisco-ios-replace-config if-appnav regexp "(\ninterface AppNav\\S+).*?(\n!)"
    (CISCOIOS-515 / RT26987)

  - Added AppNav static warnings:
     "ac with local ip is being removed\\. service context cannot be enabled"
     "service context must have a appnav controller group attached to it before it can be enabled"
     "last vrf removed\\. disable this service-context"
    (CISCOIOS-515 / RT26987)

  - Raised default retry counter from 66 to 90. Change with the ned-setting
     cisco-ios behaviour config-output-max-retries

Corrections:

  - Fixed problem with live-status exec any command interpreting "Device#" in
     show verison command as prompt.
    (CISCOIOS-579 / RT27401)

  - API CHANGE:
     Bug-fixed cisco-ios-replace-config list ned-setting, it can not handle
     multiple replacements in same config. Due to this fix, a "\n" is needed
     in injected before replacing a single line, e.g:
      cisco-ios-replace-config x regexp "\nno service-routing capabilities-manager"
    (CISCOIOS-574 / RT27673)

  - Fixed service-insertion order dependencies by always deleting them first
     and adding them last in a transaction, hence no longer dependant on
     interface cli-diff-dependency annotations.
    Removed suppress-no on 'service-insertion service-context * / enable'
    (CISCOIOS-515 / RT26987)

  - Restored cisco-ios-inject-config ned-setting temporarily broken in 5.1.1.


cisco-ios v5.1.1 [April 5, 2017]
================================

    WARNING:
    Calculating southbounds diffs using nso-4.0.4 may take "forever" due to
    a NSO bug (Issue tracker: #22205). Manifests when CDB contains many vlans.
    If you think you are experiencing this problem, upgrade to nso-4.0.5.

Enhancements:

  - Added cisco-ios-replace-config list ned-setting, usable for replacing or
     filtering out config line(s) upon reading config from device. See README
     for more details.
    (CISCOIOS-578)

  - Added 'where' leaf in cisco-ios-inject-config ned-setting list entry in
     order to be able to inject config last when syncing from device.
    (CISCOIOS-575)

  - Support for device encrypted cipher in:
     domain * / vrf * / border / password
    (CISCOIOS-574 / RT27673)

  - Support for running multiple commands in 'live-status exec any' and config
     mode 'exec' commands. Use the delimiter " ; " (note: must be white spaces)
     to separate each command. If need to answer prompts, supply them separatedly
     for each command, e.g.:
       exec "command 1 | prompts Y ; command 2 | prompts N"
     Warning: No error checking is done on command output, i.e. this command
              is 100% raw, you must check the errors yourself. Only exception
              (of course) is that config command may not leave config mode.
    (CISCOIOS-517 / RT26989)

Corrections:

  - Fixed order dependency problem between 'ipv6 access-list' and:
     interface * / ipv6 traffic-filter * <acl> in|out
     interface * / ipv6 verify unicast reverse-path <acl>
     snmp-server community * ipv6 <acl>
     snmp-server group * ipv6 <acl>
     snmp-server user * access ipv6 <acl>
    (CISCOIOS-576)

  - Removed order-by user from 'privilege exec level *' list.
    Strip meta-data prefix in NedSecrets if shown, to avoid bad regexp.
    (CISCOIOS-574 / RT27673)

=================================

    WARNING:
    Calculating southbounds diffs using nso-4.0.4 may take "forever" due to
    a NSO bug (Issue tracker: #22205). Manifests when CDB contains many vlans.
    If you think you are experiencing this problem, upgrade to nso-4.0.5.

Enhancements:

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     vrf definition * / address-family ipv4 / import map
    (CISCOIOS-573 / RT27660)

  - Added DOTALL to inject-command pattern lookup.
    (CISCOIOS-573 / RT27660)

  - Added "| noprompts" option to live-status exec commands in order to be able
     to ignore (erronously) triggered question prompts. Also added 'IGNORE' as
     an option to '| prompts' in order to specify what prompts to ignore.
    (CISCOIOS-568)

  - Recognize "Cisco Wide Area Application Services Software" show version
     string as an IOS device.
    Improved exec proxy startup error checking.
    (CISCOIOS-567 / RT27524)

  - Added static warning exception for 'ip vrf * / no route-target' config:
     "unable to remove extended community"
    Please note that you can always set your own dynamic warning exceptions
     using the cisco-ios-config-warning ned-setting. See README for details.
    (CISCOIOS-562 / RT27476)

  - Added static warning exception for 'interface * / mdix auto' config:
     "speed auto-negotiation also needs to be set for auto-mdix to take effect"
    Please note that you can always set your own dynamic warning exceptions
     using the cisco-ios-config-warning ned-setting. See README for details.
    (CISCOIOS-552 / RT27374)

  - Log proxy ned-settings before use.

Corrections:

  - Fixed problems with 'key config-key password-encrypt' command.
    (CISCOIOS-571 / RT27552)

  - API CHANGE
     ip dns name-list *
    Changed YANG due to erronous modelling. New design is a list with key id
     with an internal list of regular expressions in it.
    (CISCOIOS-570 / RT27542)

  - Fixed order dependency problem between:
      mls qos aggregate-policer
      policy-map * / class * / police aggregate
    (CISCOIOS-565 / RT27477)

  - Do not send empty interface standby entry when all members are deleted.
    This fix will solve the problem with transaction aborting, but there
    will still be a compare-config diff due to the fact that the device
    removes the empty list.
    (CISCOIOS-536 / RT27236)


cisco-ios v5.0.15 [March 23, 2017]

  - Added 'cisco-ios behaviour config-output-max-retries' ned-setting in order
     to configure maximum number of retries when sending config command to the
     device (default 66). Reason for retrying may be that a resource on device
     is not available yet.
    (CISCOIOS-562 / RT27476)

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     interface * / ipv6 mld query-timeout

  - Fixed order dependency problem between:
      policer aggregate *
      policy-map * / class * / police aggregate
    (CISCOIOS-565 / RT27477)

     next-fallback-path[23] to avoid misconfigure.
    (CISCOIOS-564 / RT27498)

  - Fixed dependency problem with deletion of LISP interfaces by always deleting
     them last (which may mean they do not exist, but that error is ignored).
    (CISCOIOS-560 / RT27461)

  - Fixed dependency problem with crypto tls-tunnel and local-interface causing
     creation entry to be left incomplete.

cisco-ios v5.0.11 [March 03, 2017]
==================================

    WARNING:
    Calculating southbounds diffs using nso-4.0.4 may take "forever" due to
    a NSO bug (Issue tracker: #22205). Manifests when CDB contains many vlans.
    If you think you are experiencing this problem, upgrade to nso-4.0.5.

Enhancements:

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     interface * / carrier-delay up|down
    (CISCOIOS-529 / RT27178)

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     ip igmp snooping source-only-learning age-timer
    (CISCOIOS-528 / RT27173)

  - Added an internal live-status command to force a resync of all cached
     encrypted values used by NedSecrets. Useful to solve an issue where the
     device rehashes type 7 secrets with a different seed, causing the values
     to diff from the old ones, even using the same cleartext password.
     Issue like this:
      admin@ncs# devices device <devname> live-status exec any "secrets resync"
     Note: the command will do a "show running-config" from the device, hence
           may be quote slow for large configs.
    (CISCOIOS-527 / RT27166)

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     domain * / border / advanced / smart-probes burst
    (CISCOIOS-526 / RT27169)

Corrections:

  - NED sorts reverse order of 'no line vty .*' commands
    for example consider following two commands:
      - no line vty 12 15
      - no line vty 16 25
    when NED executes 'no line vty 12 15' device also deletes 'no line vty 16 25,
    and when NED sends 'no line vty 16 25' device throws '% Invalid input detected' error,
    so to handle this NED sort the above command in reverse order. delete bigger number first.

    (CISCOIOS-205)

  - Changed(revert) following leafs type to boolean combined with 'tailf:cli-boolean-no'
      - /cdp/run
      - /interface * /cdp/enable
    (When above leafs have 'tailf:cli-show-no', it  displayed as 'no <name>' when it does not exist.
    This is an issue because not all interface supports 'cdp' command)
    (CISCOIOS-200)

  - Removed / interface * / ip mroute-cache distributed
    (Added ned-settings / cisco-ios-use-ip-mroute-cache-distributed)

    - some devices/versions only allows 'ip mroute-cache distributed' and some devices/versions
      only allows 'ip mroute-cache'. but devices shows 'ip mroute-cache'
      when show running-config is executed. To avoid compare-config diff and
      rollback issue, we can use this ned-setting.
    (CISCOIOS-201)

  - Added tailf:cli-reset-container in /aaa authentication login *
    (CISCOIOS-214)

  - Added tailf:cli-diff-dependency (dependency to /interface *) in // logging source-interface *

     platform qos marker-statistics
     snmp mib persist v3mibs
    (RT23550)

Corrections:

  - Fixed problem with live-status exec any copy command.
    Added command ignore pattern on: [OK] and [Done]
    (RT23602)

  - API CHANGE: Added route-map set community choice for 'none' value.
    (RT23596)

  - Yet another interface speed auto vs duplex auto dependency fix.
    Correct order for FastEthernet on cat3550:
     interface *
      duplex auto
      speed auto
    Correct order for all else:
     interface *
      speed auto
      duplex auto
    (RT23163)

  - Fixed interface ip ospf vs switchport order dependency, correct order is:
     interface *

cisco-ios v4.3.1 [June 17, 2016]
================================

Enhancements:

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     interface * / ip authentication key-chain eigrp *
     interface * / ip authentication mode eigrp *
     interface * / ipv6 summary-address eigrp *
     interface * / no ip split-horizon
     interface * / ip split-horizon eigrp no-list *
     router * / distribute-list prefix-list
     router eigrp * / address-family ipv6 unicast vrf *
     router eigrp * / address-family ipv6
     router eigrp * / summary-metric *
    (RT23457)

  - API CHANGE:
    ip community-list <number> has been changed to a single list, from two
    separate ones, in order to allow for easier handling of the new ned-setting
    cisco-ios-auto / ip-community-list-repopulate. This setting is used to
    restore the ip community-list on gateways which delete the entire list when
    one entry is deleted. NCS will then restore the list if the option is set.
    (RT23405)

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     router eigrp * / metric
    (RT23438)

Corrections:

  - Fixed interface vrf and ip address dependency problem, correct order is:
     interface * /
      [ip] vrf
      ip address
    (CISCOIOS-166)

  - Fixed support for multiple address entries in
     ip dns view * / domain name-server vrf *
    (RT23464)

  - NCS/NSO workaround:
    Trim quotes erronously inserted by service node in live-status exec cmd.
    (RT23355)

  - API CHANGE:
     Added support for configuring vrf in:
      flow exporter * / destination
    (RT23438)

  - API CHANGE:
     interface Cable* / cable upstream * rate-limit
     interface Cable* / cable upstream * shutdown
    changed from show-no type empty to boolean-no type boolean.
    (CISCOIOS-161)

  - If answer (sent by prompts) is only one character, don't send NL (newline).


cisco-ios v4.3 [June 10, 2016]
==============================

Enhancements:

  - API CHANGE:
    All access-list's collected in a single list /access-list/access-list
    Fixed bug with editing entries. The device deleted the entire acl when a
    single rule was deleted but NSO did not. This has now been fixed by having
    NCS repopulate the ACL list after a rule delete.
    (RT23353)

  - Additions to the YANG model:
    interface * / ip ospf authentication key-chain
    key chain * / key * / cryptographic-algorithm

     router ospfv3 * / address-family ipv6 unicast vrf *
    (RT23350)

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     interface * / service instance * ethernet / encapsulation untagged , dot1q
    (RT23328)

  - Rewrote the implementation for replacing encrypted device secrets with
    the cleartext cdb value in order to avoid compare-config diff and out
    of sync with service. The new design requires support for tailf:meta-data
    which means the minimum NCS/NSO versions had to be raised accordingly.
    All transformed secrets on the device should now be supported.
   (RT22669)

  - Added support for passing answers to prompts in live-status exec and
    config exec commands. Append '| prompts <answer1> [answer2]' to command.
    Note: For hitting enter only on a prompt, add the prompt key 'ENTER'
    Examples:
     admin@ncs(config-config)# exec "key config-key password-encrypt cisco123 | prompts cisco123"

    Also implemented a ned-setting - cisco-ios-auto-prompts - which can be
    used to register standard answers to standard questions. For example:
    devices global-settings ned-settings cisco-ios-auto-prompts Q1 question
      "System configuration has been modified" answer "no"
    See README file for more info.
   (RT22669)

Corrections:

  - API CHANGE:
     interface * / service instance * ethernet / encapsulation
    changed to a choice instead of separate entries.

  - Fixed service instance dependency problem, correct order is:
     interface * / service instance * ethernet /
      encapsulation
      bridge-domain
    (RT23328)

  - Improved suppport for setting type 6 passwords on device.

  - Fixed switchport vs ip address dependency using Java, correct order:
     interface *
      no switchport
      ip address
    (RT23219)

  - Warning: Ignore info string "propagating wred configuration to" when
    modifying wrr-queue random-detect no-list
    (RT23001)

  - Default: Fixed default value problem with line * / login authentication
    (RT22801)


cisco-ios v4.2.3 [June 3, 2016]
===============================

Enhancements:

  - Additions to the YANG model:
    event manager applet * / event timer * name|ratelimit
   (RT23265)

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     ip msdp
   (RT22924)

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     policy-map * / class * / random-detect *-based aggregate
     policy-map * / class * / random-detect precedence values *
    (RT23235)

  - Added new optional method to show running-config: cisco-ios-show-running-method
    Example:
    devices device <devname> ned-settings cisco-ios-show-running-method "show running-config full"

  - Added cisco-ios-inject-config ned-settings in order to inject config to
    top of running-config. Example:
     devices global-settings ned-settings cisco-ios-inject-config test config "version TEST"
    (RT23163)

  - Set ned-settings cisco-ios-cached-show-enable to default to true.


Corrections:

  - Fixed another bridge-domain dependency issue, correct order is:
     no interface BDI *
     no bridge-domain *
    (RT23020)

  - API CHANGE:
     route-map * / match route-type *
    In order to support multiple output syntax.
    (RT23150)

  - Added unique statement on vrf definition / rd
    If duplicate, device responds: '% "rd" 1:1 already in use by VRF X'
    (RT21072)

  - Added missing default values:
    ip ssh time-out 120
    ip ssh authentication-retries 3
   (RT22801)

  - Removed confusing ip prefix-list config without seq number.
    Note: always specify seq, because the device always shows it.
    (CISCOIOS-55)

  - BUGFIX: do not insert delete of policy-map / class / bandwidth|priority percent
    unless also adding numbers back.

  - API CHANGE:
     policy-map * / class * / random-detect *-based due to support for 'aggregate'
    (RT23235)

  - API CHANGE:
    route-map * / set as-path prepend remodelled. Changed to same design as
    in cisco-nx, a multi-value string instead of 10 leaves.
    (RT22669)

  - Fixed the interface switchport order dependency;
     - interface *
        no ip address
        switchport
    (RT23219)

  - Modified the last sethook (interface / switchport create) to set
   'no ip address' instead of delete '[no] ip address' if C650* device
    since those devices show:
     interface *
      switchport
      no ip address
    where most IOS devices only show:
     interface *
      switchport
    (RT23219)

  - Removed two more sethooks due to not working well with FASTMAP:
     interface / switchport
      (delete: set 'no ip address' on interface)
     interface Port-channel.
      (delete: deleted channel-group on all Ethernet interfaces with same id)
    Add/delete dynamic config manually in transaction to avoid config diff.
    (RT23219)

  - Fixed the following interface switchport order dependencies:
     - interface *
        no ip address X
        switchport
     - interface *
        speed X
        duplex full
     - interface *
        no switchport port-security
        no switchport mode access
     - interface *
        mode access
        no switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
    WARNING: including description may breaks dependencies due to NCS/NSO bug

     interface * / ip verify source vlan dhcp-snooping
    (CISCOIOS-129)

  - Additional support for configuring passwords/keys in cleartext which get
    encrypted on the device, and still avoid a compare-config diff.
    The following secrets/keys/passwords were added:
     ip wccp * key
     mpls ldp neighbor *
     radius-server host * key
     tacacs-server host * key
     username * password
     username * secret
    (RT22801)

Corrections:

    to support cleartext to encrypted device conversion without config diff.
    (RT22669)

  - API CHANGE:

    (RT22801)

  - Fixed dependency problem with ipv6 neighbor and interface.
    (RT22978)


cisco-ios v4.2.0 [May 13, 2016]
===============================

Enhancements:

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     cable service class * activity-timeout
     cable service class * admission-timeout
     cable service class * max-latency
     cable service class * min-packet-size
     cable service class * req-attr-mask

      NOTE: Use: cable cm-status enable no-list
     interface Wideband-Cable* / cable ds-resiliency
    (RT22958)

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     interface * / ip flow monitor * input
     interface * / ip flow monitor * output
     interface * / no nhrp route-watch
     router eigrp * / address-family ipv4 / af-interface * / summary-address

     l2tp-class * / authentication
     l2tp-class * / password
     pseudowire-class * / ip local interface
     pseudowire-class * / protocol
    (CISCOIOS-123)

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     interface * / bfd template
    (RT22871)

  - Added 'any' exec command under live-status to be able to execute any IOS
    command on the device. For example:
    admin@ncs# devices device ios1921-2 live-status exec any "show ppp summary"

  - Added 'verify' exec command under live-status.
    (CISCOIOS-116)

  - Support for configuring shared secrets in cleartext which get encrypted
    on the device. The encrypted secret from the device is replaced with the
    clear text from the CDB if the device config has not changed. If the
    secret is changed out-of-band the new value will be shown, i.e. cause
    a compare-config diff, which it should.
    The following secrets/keys/passwords are supported:
     enable password
     enable secret
     ip ftp password
     mpls ldp password fallback
     radius-server key
     tacacs-server key
    (RT22801)

  - Added info from output of 'show version in cached-show container in
    tailf-ned-cisco-ios module for fast access in service code. Info is
    updated upon login, i.e. may change if output of show version changes.
    Enable by setting: ned-settings cisco-ios-cached-show-enable version true
    Example output:
      cached-show version version 15.4(3)S4
      cached-show version model ME-3800X-24FS-M
      cached-show version license level MetroIPServices
      cached-show version license type Permanent
    Note: Even though this info is in config, obviously it is not config
          and can not be set on the device.
    (RT22867)

Corrections:

  - Changed most cli-diff-dependency statements to use relative paths instead
    of absolute paths to avoid a bug in ncs-3.4 branch.
    As a result, the following config has changed YANG path:
     ipv6 routing
    (CISCOIOS-127)

  - API CHANGE:
    Changed 'ip forward protocol udp' API in order to allow support for
    no-entries and entries. Remodelled as a list using optional disabled
    keyword. For example: set 'ip forward-protocol udp tftp disabled" for
    'no ip forward-protocol udp tftp'.
    (RT22958)

  - API CHANGE (internal leaves renamed) due to support for hidden secrets:
     aaa group server tacacs+ * / server-private * key
     interface * / standby * authentication md5 key-string
     interface * / vrrp * authentication md5 key-string
     ip ftp password
     key chain * / key * / key-string
     radius server * / key
     router lisp / ipv4 etr map-server * key
     tacacs-server host * key
     tacacs-server key
     username * password

  - Removed sethook on crypto pki trustpoint. Add dynamic config manually.
    (CISCOIOS-115)

  - Redesigned confirmation handling when applying config. Always begin by
    sending a 'y'. If no prompt after 1 second, send 'es\n' in order to
    complete a 'yes\n' to avoid getting stuck at questions. Reason for change
    is that now almost all confirmation prompts will be supported.
    (CISCOIOS-115)


cisco-ios v4.1.6 [May 4, 2016]
==============================

Enhancements:

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     router lisp / locator-table
     router lisp / loc-reach-algorithm rloc-probing
     router ospf * / redistribute lisp subnets
    (RT22785)

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     mpls ldp password fallback
    (RT22800)

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     interface * / ethernet oam link-monitor receive-crc window
     interface * / isis bfd disable
     interface * / isis hello-multiplier
     router ospf * / prefix-priority high route-map
    (RT22802)

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     call-home / vrf
     interface * / tunnel mode ipv6
     ip dhcp use vrf remote
     ip dns name-list *

     parameter-map type inspect * / threat-detection rate fw-drop
     parameter-map type inspect * / threat-detection rate inspect-drop
     parameter-map type inspect * / vrf * inspect
     virtual-service / ip shared host-interface
     virtual-service / activate
    (CISCOIOS-90)

Corrections:

  - Fixed compare-config diff when setting line * / exec, hidden default.

  - Removed ordered-by "user" on snmp-server enable traps list.
    (RT22801)

  - Corrected spelling in 'mpls ldp neighbor * labels accept', was lables
    (RT22803)

  - Special reorder fix for NCS bug manifesting in router ospf / max-metric
    (Fixed in NCS 3.4.5 or newer)

  - Fixed ordering isssues in router * / distribute-list when adding and
    deleting entries.

  - Reviewed and added several vrf dependency cli annotations.

  - Added ipv6 unicast-routing dependency on router bgp * / address-family ipv6.


cisco-ios v4.1.5 [April 28, 2016]
=================================

Enhancements:

  - Expanded the YANG model in:
     interface * / dialer map ip *
    (RT22769)

  - sdm prefer expansions to the YANG model.
    (RT22734)

  - Improved and bugfixed login code.
    (RT22712)

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     router odr
     router ospfv3 * / shutdown

  - Improved drned test system. Removed old lux tests.
    (CISCOIOS-87)

Corrections:

  - Fixed switchport dependency issue, correct order is:
     interface *
      no switchport nonegotiate
      no switchport mode access
    (RT22766)

  - Fixed interface * / mls qos vlan-based vs interface * / service-policy
    dependency problem.
    (RT22748)

  - Added cli-replace-all on 'line * / transport input|output'.
    (RT22717)

  - Removed sethook on 'ip vrf' which used to automatically clear
    'ip vrf forwarding' on all interfaces as well as delete all routes
    using the same vrf. Reason being dynamic sethooks have proven to
    cause problems with FASTMAP as well as cauing unwanted config changes.
    If you want to mimic the device behaviour of cleaning vrf config when
    a vrf is deleted, you have to add those deletes to your transaction
    as well in order to avoid config diff.
    (RT22686)

  - Removed sethook on 'ip routing'. See reason above.

  - Fixed problem with banner in newer NCS/NSO versions.

  - Fixed support for live-status exec reload without giving an error.


cisco-ios v4.1.4 [April 20, 2016]
=================================

Enhancements:

  - Made the automatic ip address reconfiguration upon vrf forwarding change
    on interfaces configurable. Default is off. To enable:

    (RT20304)

  - Answer yes on 'ACCEPT? (yes/[no])' pattern.

Corrections:

  - Fixed interface * /crypto map vs crypto map dependency.
    (RT22592)

  - Answer 'yes' instead of 'y' if prompt regarding destroying certificates.

  - Ignore retry on 'please remove .* from .* first' pattern.

  - Do not accept cisco-ios-inject-interface-config without interface config.


cisco-ios v4.1.3 [April 11, 2016]
=================================

Enhancements:

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     Add output of BOOT path-list from 'show boot' to boot system config
     in order to avoid a diff. Note: For devices which only support one
     boot system entry you have to delete the old entry explicitly since
     cisco-ios supports multiple entries.
    (RT22491)

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     interface * / lacp min-bundle
     interface * / vrrp * vrrs leader
     interface * / vrrp * address
     interface * / vrrs pathway *
     ipv6 neighbor *
    (CISCOIOS-90)

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     boot config
     ip dhcp pool * / bootfile
     interface * / ipv6 dhcp client information refresh minimum
     interface * / ipv6 verify unicast source reachable-via
     interface * / isdn termination multidrop

     mls qos min-reserve *
     radius-server attribute * mandatory
     route-map * / set ip qos-group
    (CISCOIOS-87)

  - Added a new optional method for NETSIM to calculate transaction id:
     cisco-ios-transaction-id-method confd-state-trans-id
    which uses 'show confd-state internal cdb datastore running transaction-id'

  - Improved login code to be more robust in order to improve chance of
    logging in on devices with banner(s) confusing the login process.

  - Disable additional show commands for show() if non existant to save
    bandwidth.


Corrections:

  - Fixed interface * / channel-group vs interface * / mls dependency.
    (RT22459)

  - Reverted the bad fix in 4.0.5.1 where Port-channel interfaces did not
    show "no shutdown" when shutdown. The reason being, without it it was
    not possible to bring down a newly created Port-channel interface since
    nothing was sent and the interface default to 'shutdown' when created.
    For those who want to create a shutdown Port-channel interface they
    have to set shutdown explicitly when creating the interface to match
    the device which usually brings up Port-channel as shutdown.
    (RT22456)

  - Removed all use of cli-trigger-on-delete since it turns out it has
    no other effect than negating cli-trigger-on-set, making it into a
    normal cli-diff-dependency.
    (TRAC 14332)

  - API CHANGE: mgcp behavior changed from hardcoded config to a list.

  - Ignore set/delete of unsupported injected interface config.

  - Improved snmp-server user config creation from 'show snmp user' and
    added support for access-list info.

  - Set verbose logging to default false. Enable with cisco-ios-log-verbose
    ned-settings option.

Corrections:

  - API CHANGE: ip forward-protocol udp changed from leaf to leaf-list.
    (RT22007)

  - Reworked switchport API:
     IMPORTANT NOTE: Devices which do not show 'switchport' when enabled
      must configure cisco-ios-inject-interface-config to inject it.
      See the README file.
     'no switchport' is shown on all Ethernet and Port-channel interfaces
      by default (with help of a static global config inject)
     API CHANGES:
      Removed interface * / no-switchport and yes-switchport
       (always use interface * / switchport container)
      Removed tailfned switchport config (show-no and show-yes)
      Removed cisco-ios-switchport-format ned-setting.
      Removed switchport on wlan-ap, BDI, Vlan and Virtual-Template if.
    (CISCOIOS-33)

  - API CHANGE: ipv6 cef

  - Added 'presence true' in 'domain * / vrf * / border' container.
    (RT22068)

    (RT21612) (RT22102)

  - Completely reworked switchport dependencies due to yet another problem.
    (RT22066)

  - Removed sethooks on interface * / vrf forwarding | ip vrf forwarding
     which deleted all IP addresses on interface, introduced in 3.11.0.9.
     One reason was that it stopped reconfiguration of IP address in fastmap.
     Introduced new Java code which automatically writes back the primary IP
     from the CDB to the device if vrf forwarding is modified.
     This will preserve the interface IP address configuration in CDB.
     Note: Code needs to be expanded to also write back secondary addresses.
    (RT20304) (CISCOIOS-61)

  - Added subinterface dependencies to base interface to fix delete problem.

  - API CHANGE: removed support for 'random-detect' without argument.

  - Always use 'random-detect precedence-based' to enable precedence.
     On a real device this config is hidden, showing only 'random-detect',
     but the NED auto-converts that to 'random-detect precedence-based.
    (RT21996)

  - Fixed more mls qos clean up bugs.
    (RT21705)

  - Fixed policy-map * / class * / shape vs queue-limit dependency.
    (RT21989)

  - Joined switchport enable switch and config for show-no devices in order
     to be able to delete separate config when disabling switchport.

cisco-ios v3.0 [March 4, 2014]
==============================

This release is function wise equivalent to the previous release, which was 1.8.
The only difference is that this NED now is maintained using
a new product life-cycle which is independent of the NCS release life-cycle.

The version number 3.0 has been chosen to indicate a common baseline for
all NEDs, which is higher than any previous NED version.

For this NED no upgrades are necessary.

The Tail-f package: cisco-ios NED was initially imported 2014-02-25
